ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aladdin, I am an inspiring developer in my early twenties. I've started my journey with web development in learning Html/Css and currently starting to learn 
javascript, and after that i'll try to learn and apply different frameworks.
Iâ€™m interested in web development and Ros and robotics, I'm also very interested in learning ethical hacking. I am hoping to be able to learn and use what i learn in the
real world, and contribute to open source.
